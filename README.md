**Q: How accurate is voice recognition?**
A: Very accurate for clear speech in quiet environments. The AI system handles partial matches and synonyms well.

### AI Image Recognition

**Q: How does image recognition work?**
A: The app uses Hack Club's AI API to analyze uploaded images and provide single-word content descriptions like "shop", "street", or "person".

**Q: Can I turn off image recognition?**
A: Yes! Click the üîç AI Vision button to toggle image recognition on/off. When disabled, no images are analyzed.

**Q: What types of content can be recognized?**
A: Common categories include: shop, street, person, food, animal, building, nature, vehicle, document, art, and more.

**Q: Is image recognition accurate?**
A: Generally very accurate for common objects and scenes. Results may vary with unusual or abstract images.

**Q: Does image recognition cost extra?**
A: No, it uses the same free Hack Club AI API. However, it does require an internet connection.

### Technical Questions

**Q: How do I enable voice control in Firefox?**
A: Go to `about:config`, search for `media.webspeech.recognition.enable` and `media.webspeech.recognition.force_enable`, set both to `true`, then restart Firefox.

**Q: Can I host this on my own server?**
A: Yes! Follow the production deployment guide. Requires Python 3.11+, and HTTPS for voice features.

**Q: Is my data stored anywhere?**
